Thus, the proportional odds assumption holds for the simplified model.\n## `brms`\n\nBelow is a model implementation using the brms package. We will just use the default priors for this. The exercise is to run this code and note your observations. What are salient differences you observe in how the model fitting takes place With respect to the results, how do you compare the results of the model you fit with clm and the one you fit with brms?\n\n\n\nCode\n  ols2_brm &lt;- brm(Technical_Rank ~ Gender * Age, \n                  data = gb, \n                  family = cumulative, \n                  cores = 4, \n                  chains = 4, \n                  seed = 123)\n\n\nWhile both clm and brms provide very similar point estimates and conclusions regarding the effects of Gender, Age, and their interaction on Technical_Rank, the Bayesian approach (brms) offers richer information regarding uncertainty (CI) and additional convergence diagnostics.\n\nThe conditional_effects function is used to plot predicted probabilities by Gender and Age across each rank.\n::: {.cell}\n\nCode\nconditional_effects(ols2_brm, categorical = T)\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}  :::\n::: {.cell-output-display}  ::: :::\ncheck_predictions from the easystats performance package is used for examining model fit (i.e., does the data fit the model being used?). Run the below code. What do you think?\n\n\n\nCode\ncheck_predictions(ols2_brm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function shows how well the Bayesian model’s predictions align with the data. The green dots represent the actual counts (or frequencies) for each category of Technical_Rank in the dataset. The blue dots and error bars represent the mean (or median) model-predicted counts, while the error bars reflect the uncertainty (95% CI) around the predictions. The model predictions align fairly well with the actual data."

Write short and informative commit messages, and share the link to your assignment with me. If not, you can also send me the rmd & rendered file via Canvas.\nIn this assignment, you will not need to code from scratch. Rather, you’ll need to fill in code where needed. This assignment has a logisitic regression implementation for a scenario from EDA down to model comparison (and would be useful for whenever you may encounter such a situation in the future).\nI want the assignments to begin reflecting a bit more of how you’d be doing things on your own, where you have some prior knowledge and you figure other things out (by referring to documentation, etc.) . In addition to the rmd, I also want you to submit to me notes of anything new that you learn while finishing the assignment. And any pain-points, and we’ll discuss more.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you are fitting a model, display the model output in a neatly formatted table. (The gt tidy and kable functions can help!). Modelsummary also looks good(https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelsummary.html)\nMake sure that your plots are clearly labeled – for all axes, titles, etc."

In addition to collecting demographic information, the survey includes questions used to gauge attitudes about government spending priorities, confidence in institutions, lifestyle, and many other topics. A full description of the survey may be found here.\nThe data for this lab are from the 2016 General Social Survey. The original data set contains 2867 observations and 935 variables. We will use and abbreviated data set that includes the following variables:\nnatmass: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:\n“We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be solved easily or inexpensively. I’m going to name some of these problems, and for each one I’d like you to tell me whether you think we’re spending too much money on it, too little money, or about the right amount…are we spending too much, too little, or about the right amount on mass transportation?”\nage: Age in years.\nsex: Sex recorded as male or female\nsei10: Socioeconomic index from 0 to 100\nregion: Region where interview took place\npolviews: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:\n“We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. I’m going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal - point 1 - to extremely conservative - point 7. Where would you place yourself on this scale?”\nThe data are in gss2016.csv in the data folder."

    "text": "Conclusion\nBased on the model summary below, and the three figures, we can conclude that both demographic factors and political views significantly influence satisfaction with mass transportation spending. Specifically, women are more likely to support current spending than men, older individuals are less likely to support current spending, and individuals with higher SES are less likely to support current spending. Political views also play a significant role, with conservatives more likely to support current spending than liberal individuals.\nThe logistic regression model fits the data reasonably well, but the residual analysis suggests SES might have a non-linear relationship with satisfaction. The R^2 value indicates that while the model explains some variability, additional factors may be at play. Future research could explore more complex relationships between SES and satisfaction to improve model fit.\n\n\n\n\nDf\nDeviance\nResid. Df\nResid.

In this model, higher educational attainment is associated with higher predicted probabilities of being a consistent voter (“always”), while lower education levels are linked to increased probabilities of being sporadic or rarely/never voters. And these differences are statistically significant. The pairwise comparisons further confirm that adjacent education levels differ meaningfully in their impact on voting frequency, suggesting that educational attainment is an important predictor of voting behavior."

    "text": "Data\nThe data for this assignment comes from an online Ipsos survey that was conducted for the FiveThirtyEight article “Why Many Americans Don’t Vote”. You can read more about the survey design and respondents in the README of the GitHub repo for the data.\nRespondents were asked a variety of questions about their political beliefs, thoughts on multiple issues, and voting behavior. We will focus on using the demographic variables and someone’s party identification to understand whether a person is a probable voter.\nThe variables we’ll focus on were (definitions from the codebook in data set GitHub repo):\n\nppage: Age of respondent\neduc: Highest educational attainment category.\n\nrace: Race of respondent, census categories. Note: all categories except Hispanic were non-Hispanic.\ngender: Gender of respondent\nincome_cat: Household income category of respondent\nQ30: Response to the question “Generally speaking, do you think of yourself as a…”\n\n1: Republican\n2: Democrat\n3: Independent\n4: Another party, please specify\n5: No preference\n-1: No response\n\nvoter_category: past voting behavior:\n\nalways: respondent voted in all or all-but-one of the elections they were eligible in\nsporadic: respondent voted in at least two, but fewer than all-but-one of the elections they were eligible in\nrarely/never: respondent voted in 0 or 1 of the elections they were eligible in\n\n\nYou can read in the data directly from the GitHub repo:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(nnet)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(emmeans)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(parameters)\nlibrary(easystats)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nvoter_data &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/non-voters/nonvoters_data.csv\")"

In this model, higher educational attainment is associated with higher predicted probabilities of being a consistent voter (“always”), while lower education levels are linked to increased probabilities of being sporadic or rarely/never voters. And these differences are statistically significant. The pairwise comparisons further confirm that adjacent education levels differ meaningfully in their impact on voting frequency, suggesting that educational attainment is an important predictor of voting behavior."
